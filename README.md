# WEB7-Framework-Examples
A repo to store framework stack examples for WEB7.

After consideration these frameworks will be a Svelte framework and the Angular framework.

#Starting The Applications
Upon cloning or download of the project I suggest that you use the following npm command in both project directories aswell as the frontend directory of each stack.

`npm install`

Once that is done you can use the following commands in the root directory of each stack.
`npm start` launches the backend of the application
`npm run client` launches the frontend
`npm run dev` launches the full application
